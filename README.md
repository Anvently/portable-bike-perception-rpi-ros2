# Cyclo-safe : a multi-sensor bike perception module (Camera, Dual 360Â° Lidar, GPS, Raspberry Pi, ROS2)

> The aim of the CycloSafe project is to improve cyclist safety by rigorously quantifying the risks they face, with a particular focus on those occurring when being overtaken by a motor vehicle.
> 
> To do this, we have equipped a bicycle with LIDARs (Light Detection and Ranging), a camera and a GNSS antenna.

This repository contains :
- the firmware intended to run on a **Raspberry Pi** to operate all the sensors and **take measurements**
- Various tools to **export**, **visualize**, and **analyze** the collected data
- Files required for **3D printing the case**
- File needed to manufacture the **dedicated PCB**.  
It was developed as part of an experimental data acquisition system for an academic research study on cyclist safety.

## About the Cyclo-safe project

This project is part of the broader **CycloSafe** research initiative conducted at the **Institut national de lâ€™information gÃ©ographique et forestiÃ¨re (IGN)**, which aims **to quantify the risks faced by cyclists when being overtaken by motor vehicles**.

This repository is dedicated **exclusively to the design and implementation of the acquisition module** used to collect measurement data for the study, along with a set of **tools for processing, visualizing, and analyzing** the recorded data.

It does **not** present or discuss the **results** of the study itself, and should not be directly associated with its conclusions or interpretations.
